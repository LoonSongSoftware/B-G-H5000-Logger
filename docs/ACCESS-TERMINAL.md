In Linux, the command line can be obtained by running a "terminal" application (often
by pressing Ctrl-Alt-t on the keyboard) or by connecting via secure shell (ssh) from
another machine. 

(To make an `ssh` connection to a headless target machine (like a Raspberry Pi)
on the H5000 Ethernet or WiFi network, you'll need to figure out what the headless
machine's IP address is. There are plenty of "network ping" applications available on Windows,
Linux and iOS to do this.)
